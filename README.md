# Frogger-Style Arcade Game
Udacity Front End Web Development - Project 3: Arcade Game
## Synopsis

This is my third of a series of projects through Udacity's **Front End Web Development** course, through which I have been reviewing web fundamentals including HTML5, CSS and JavaScript.  This project involves some object oriented JavaScript and the use of HTML5 Canvas to create a simple animated game.

## Files

* **index.html :** Contains the structure and calls to the JavaScript and CSS
* **style.css :** Contains styling
* **images (folder) :** Contains all the png images used to render the game
* **app.js :** Most the code for the game is here
* **engine.js :** Provides game loop functionality and renders our game
* **resources.js :** Image loading utility.  Included in the class starter files for the game

## Instructions

1. Open index.html in a browser
2. Pick a character and select the "Start Game" button
3. Use the arrow keys to move the player and collect gems

Avoid the bugs! *you only have 3 lives per game

Once all the gems are collected, the game is won!
